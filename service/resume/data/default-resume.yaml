          I seek out new technologies and look for how they might benefit my current work. After I find something useful and applicable, I love to share this with my team - and strive to help my whole group excel. For example while working as a contractor at University of Phoenix, I volunteered and then lead a talk on building AWS Lambda functions using Rust.
